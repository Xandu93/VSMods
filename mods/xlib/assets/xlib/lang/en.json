You can increase this level by gathering experience doing activities related to this skill. With every level you also receive an ability point for this skill. To see an overview of your skills and abilities press the [O] key(default). You can change this key in the settings menu.<br><br><strong>Ability</strong><br>An ability gives you a specific advantage for a specific skill related activity. Most abilities have more than one tiers. Higher tiers of an ability provide more advantages. To increase the tier of an ability you need one ability point of the skill the ability belongs to. Than you can click on the ability in the skill dialog to increase its tier. You can also decrease the tier of an ability. To do so you must toggle the mode to unlearn mode by clicking the unlearn button. Now you can click on the ability to decrease the tier of the ability. Remember to toggle the unlearn button again to disable the unlearn mode. Notice that you need unlearn points to decrease the tier of an ability. When you decrease the tier of an ability you will get back the ability point you used. While ability points are bound to a specific skill, unlearn points are shared across all skills. You can receive unlearn points from consuming specific items. These items can be found in the handbook.",
